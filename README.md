Group Data Collection Project
=============================

This is the 3715 final (term) project.

Getting started
---------------

1. Run `ant git-fix`. This will recreate a number of empty folders that Git won't add to a repository.
2. Run `ant`.
3. Open <http://localhost:8888/> in your browser.
4. Enjoy.

How do I use the application?
-----------------------------

Eventually there'll be something here.

Ideas for improvement
---------------------

- [Intro.js](http://usablica.github.com/intro.js/)
- [Cornify](http://www.cornify.com/)
- Realtime via <https://github.com/videlalvaro/gifsockets>?

Still to be done
----------------

- Text at the bottom of the homepage
- Add/remove collaborators
- Export dataset (import will be difficult.)
