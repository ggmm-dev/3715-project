Group Data Collection Project
=============================

This is the 3715 final (term) project.

Getting started
---------------

1. Run `ant git-fix`. This will recreate a number of empty folders that Git won't add to a repository.
2. Run `ant`.
3. Open <http://localhost:8888/> in your browser.
4. Enjoy.

How do I use the application?
-----------------------------

Eventually there'll be something here.
